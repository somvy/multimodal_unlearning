# available losses 
# retain_ft - finetune on retain
# grad_ascent - maximize loss on forget
# grad_diff_forget_ce_retain_ce  - loss on retain  minus loss on forget (cross entropy both)
# grad_diff_forget_entropy_retain_ce - crossentropy (CE) on retain minus entropy on forget
# grad_diff_forget_entropy_retain_KL - KL on retain minus entropy on forget
# grad_diff_forget_ce_retain_KL -  KL between original and current model on retain minus loss on forget
# grad_diff_forget_KL_retain_KL - KL between original and current model on retain minus KL between original and current model on forget
# grad_diff_forget_KL_retain_CE - crossentropy on retain minus KL between original and current model on forget
# KL - forget CE loss + KL divergence between old model and current on retain
# idk - finetune on pairs (forget, i dont know)
# dpo - modified dpo loss 
# npo - negative preference optimization
# scrub - teacher-student training, KL(teacher, student) + KL(student, teacher)
# eco - corrupt prompt on the forget set with pretrained token and promptclassifier
# eco_ft - pretrain on corrupted prompts from eco
# LLMU - 
# RMU - Representation Misdirection for Unlearning 
# influence - 
# multi delete
